                    <span>Welcome to the KGS Ho Chi Minh Campus website. Our school is proud to offer the international Cambridge Curriculum to Korean students in Vietnam. With campuses in Ho Chi Minh and Hanoi, we aim to foster global talents who will become future leaders in their fields of choice. Our institution is young and dynamic, just like the Vietnamese economy. We are continuously growing, driven by an enterprising and challenging spirit. Our primary focus is on providing a comprehensive English education while also cultivating talented individuals who can adapt well to Korean universities by combining Korean language and mathematics. Ho Chi Minh City is the economic hub of Vietnam, and with close ties to Korea, our students are becoming valuable global talents who can act as a bridge between the two countries. We aim to connect with the Ho Chi Minh community by building on Korean tradition and culture. Our faculty and staff are dedicated to achieving our educational goals, and we strive to provide the best education for our students through close collaboration with parents, teachers, students, and the community. We promise to do our best to ensure that our students have a safe and enriching school life. Thank you.</span>
